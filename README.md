## mqtt-3-async

This project demonstrates the simplest possible use of the mqtt v3 asynchronous API flavour of the
mqtt-bee client using default settings wherever possible. A good place to start if it's your first
time using mqtt-bee.

## mqtt-3-blocking

Here we demonstrate using the blocking API, which is the simplest, but as the name suggests, will
block execution until the operation has completed.
